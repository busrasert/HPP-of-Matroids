# HPP-of-Matroids
Code files for testing the half-plane property and some other properties of matroids 

Those are additional files provided for the pre-print https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09610 on arXiv
that is a joint work with Mario Kummer (see also Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/6109216). 

For the database of matroids on eight and nine elements with the HPP, see Zenodo:https://zenodo.org/record/6108027.
